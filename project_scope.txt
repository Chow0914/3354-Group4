The scope of this project is to design and develop a simple Personal Contact Management System called SmartContacts that allows users to store and manage their contact information through a clean and easy-to-use web interface. 
The system will provide core features such as adding, viewing, editing, searching, and deleting contacts. 
Each contact entry will include fields like name, phone number, email, and optional notes or tags.
This project will be developed using Flask/Python with SQLite and will follow the MVC architecture to keep the interface, logic, and data layers organized. 
The target environment is a standard university setup, meaning the system should run smoothly on typical lab computers and modern web browsers like Chrome or Firefox.
Since this is an academic project, the scale will remain manageable and focused on core functionality rather than advanced features like user accounts, cloud syncing, or mobile app deployment. 
However, the system should still demonstrate proper software engineering practices, including clean code structure, basic validation, and a responsive interface suitable for student users who want a lightweight and efficient way to organize their personal contacts.
